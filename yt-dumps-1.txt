1..) Which gCP service below provides a direct physical connection between your GCP environment and your
on-premises network using gCP network co-locations?
A. Cloud VPN
B. Carrier Peering
c. Dedicated Interconnect
D. Partner Interconnect

Correct Answer: C
Cloud Interconnect provides low latency, highly available connections that enable you to reliably transfer data
between your on-premises and Virtual Private Cloud networks. Also, Cloud Interconnect connections provide l
1918 communication, which means internal (private) IP addresses are directly accessible from both networks.
Cloud Interconnect offers two options for extending your on-premises network. Google Cloud Interconnect -
Dedicated (Dedicated Interconnect) provides a direct physical connection between your on-premises network and
Google's network. Google Cloud Interconnect - Partner (Partner Interconnect) provides connectivity between your
on-premises and CP VPC networks through a supported service provider.

2) Steve is the cloud admin for Blue Widget Corp. He has been asked to configure a Kubernetes-hosted
app so that it can be accessed internally by the KE cluster. It will NOT be accessed from the public
internet. Which service is suitable for exposing an internal IP address for apps that do not need to be
accessed from the public internet?
A. NodePort
B. ClusterIP
C. LoadBalancer
D. ExternalName

Correct Answer: B
ClusterIP services expose an internal IP address for apps that do not need to be accessed from the public
internet. NodePort services expose the node's IP address on a specific port. LoadBalancer and
ExternalName services both work closely with your cloud provider. The former works with your provider's
load balancer resources to expose a set of pods while the latter returns a NAME record based a DNS name
of your choosing.
-----------------------------------------
3) Which of the following Kubernetes controllers should be used for maintenance operations that must run
with exactly one pod running on each node?
A. DaemonSet
B. ReplicaSet
C. StatefulSet
D. Deployment

Correct Answer: A
DaemonSets attempt to adhere to a one-Pod-per-node model, either across the entire cluster or a
subset of nodes. As you add nodes to a node pool, DaemonSets automatically add Pods to the new
nodes as needed.

9) Jennifer is the cloud admin for Blue Widget Corp. She has been asked to build out a cloud application in
GCP that leverages the serverless architecture model. Which CP service will be of most interest to her?
A. Compute Engine
B. Kubernetes Engine
C. App Engine
D. Direct Peering
Correct Answer: C
The App Engine standard environment makes it easy to build and deploy an application that runs reliably
even under heavy load and with large amounts of data.
Applications run in a secure, sandboxed environment, allowing the App Engine standard environment to
distribute requests across multiple servers, and scaling servers to meet traffic demands. Your application
runs within its own secure, reliable environment that is independent of the hardware, operating system,
or physical location of the server.

11) When using Google BigQuery, which of the following best describes the pricing models? Choose
two options.
A. Flat-rate pricing
B. Monthly subscription tiers for processing more than
   500 terabytes per month
C. On-demand pricing
D. Capacity-pricing

Correct Answer: C
On-demand pricing (per TB). With this pricing model, you are charged for the num
processed by each query. The first 1 TB of query data processed per month is free
Capacity pricing (per slot-hour). With this pricing model, you are charged for comp
run queries, measured in slots (virtual CPUs) over time. This model takes advantag
editions. You can leverage the BigQuery autoscaler or purchase slot commitments
capacity that is always available for your workloads, at a lower price.

12) Dana, the junior cloud admin, has been asked to deploy a virtual machine on the GCP platform. Which
images below can Dana use to deploy her VM?
A. Public image
B. Custom image
C. Container image
D. None of these

Correct Answer: ABC
Dana can deploy a VM from a public, custom, or container image. There is no hybrid image option for
Google. Hybrid refers to the multi-cloud infrastructure to deploy a single application system across multiple
sites. These different sites could be different public clouds (multi-cloud) or a combination of public and on-
premises data centers (hybrid cloud).

14) To configure Stackdriver to monitor a web server and notify you if it goes down, what steps do you need
to take? (Choose 2 answers)
A. Install the Stackdriver Monitoring Agent on the web server
B. Create an uptime check
C. Create an alerting policy
D. Install the Operations Monitoring Logging Agent on the web server
Correct Answer: BC
Uptime checks verify that your web server is always accessible. The alerting policy controls who is
notified if the uptime checks should fail.
You don't need to install the Operations Suite to get downtime alerts. The agent provides additional
information, but it's not required. The Operations Monitoring Logging Agent is for additional logging, not
for alerts.
Using the Monitoring agent is optional. Operations Monitoring can access some metrics without the
Monitoring agent, including CPU utilization, some disk traffic metrics, network traffic, and uptime
information. [https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/#purpose]
